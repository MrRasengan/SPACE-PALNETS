    image: Mercury,
    fullDescription: "Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It is named after the Roman god of trade, Swift Mercury, because it moves across the sky faster than the other planets. Its period of revolution around the Sun is only 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. Mercury's apparent distance from the Sun, as seen from Earth, never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means that the planet can only be seen for a short time after sunset or before sunrise, usually at twilight. With a telescope, Mercury can be seen in phases that vary from a thin crescent to an almost full disk, like Venus and the Moon, and sometimes it passes across the disk of the Sun. The period of Mercury's phase change is equal to its synodic period of revolution, about 116 days.Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of all the planets in the Solar System about 1/30°. However, its orbital eccentricity is the highest of all the planets, and so at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface is covered with impact craters and is similar in appearance to the Moon, indicating a lack of internal geological activity in the last billion years. Since Mercury has almost no atmosphere, its surface temperature varies more than any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C) at night to 700 K (+427 °C) during the day in the equatorial regions. The polar regions are consistently cooled below 180 K (−93 °C). The planet has no known natural satellites.Mercury has been visited by two spacecraft: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975, and MESSENGER explored it from 2008 to 2015. The latter entered orbit around the planet in 2011 and, after making more than 4,000 orbits over four years, ran out of fuel and crashed into the surface on April 30, 2015. The BepiColombo spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at Mercury in 2025."

    image: Venus,
    fullDescription: "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the sixth largest in the Solar System, along with Mercury, Earth and Mars, belonging to the family of terrestrial planets. It is named after the ancient Roman goddess of love, Venus. Based on a number of characteristics, such as its mass and size, Venus is considered the sister of Earth. The Venusian year is 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest period of rotation around its axis (about 243 Earth days, an average of 243.0212 ± 0.00006 days[9]) among all the planets in the Solar System and rotates in the direction opposite to the rotation of most planets.Venus has no natural satellites. In the Earth's sky, Venus is the third brightest luminary after the Sun and the Moon. Its brightness reaches a visible stellar magnitude of −4.6m and is sufficient to cast discernible shadows at night. Venus is occasionally visible to the naked eye during daylight hours. Go to the section Astronomical characteristics.Venus has a dense atmosphere, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times greater than on the Earth's surface, and is approximately equal to the pressure of water at a depth of 900 meters. Due to the high pressure, carbon dioxide in the near-surface part of the atmosphere is no longer a gas in its aggregate state, but a supercritical liquid, so this part of the atmosphere is a semi-liquid-semi-gaseous ocean of supercritical carbon dioxide. The average surface temperature of Venus is 735 K (462 °C), which makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System, despite the fact that Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of clouds of highly reflective sulfuric acid, which obscures the surface of the planet from direct visibility. The high surface temperature is due to the greenhouse effect. Go to the Atmosphere section.As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has become an important element in human culture. Go to the Culture section It is the first planet to have its motion recorded across the sky, beginning in the second millennium BC. As the closest planet to Earth, Venus was a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was also the first planet to be visited by an Earth-based spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962) and landed on (Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's dense clouds make it impossible to observe its surface in visible light, so detailed maps of its surface were not available until the Magellan spacecraft entered orbit around Venus in 1991, conducting high-resolution radar studies of the surface of Venus. There are projects to implement more complex tasks on the surface of Venus, including using rovers, but they are hampered by the harsh conditions on the surface of Venus."

    fullDescription: "Earth is the third planet in the Solar System by distance from the Sun. It is the densest, fifth in diameter and mass among all the planets in the Solar System, and the largest among the terrestrial planets, which also include Mercury, Venus, and Mars. It is the only body in the Universe currently known to man that is inhabited by living organisms.In journalism and popular science literature, synonymous terms may be used - the world, the blue planet, Terra (from Latin Terra).Scientific data indicate that the Earth formed from a solar nebula about 4.54 billion years agoGo to the section History of the Earth and soon after that acquired its only natural satellite - the Moon. Life presumably appeared on Earth about 4.25 billion years ago, that is, soon after its originGo to the section Origin of life. Since then, the Earth's biosphere has significantly changed the atmosphere and other abiotic factors, causing a quantitative increase in aerobic organisms, as well as the formation of the ozone layer, which, together with the Earth's magnetic field, weakens harmful solar radiation, thereby maintaining the conditions for life on Earth. Radiation caused by the Earth's crust itself has significantly decreased since its formation due to the gradual decay of radionuclides contained in it. The Earth's crust is divided into several segments, or tectonic plates, which move across the surface at speeds of several centimeters per year. The study of the composition, structure and patterns of development of the Earth is the science of geologyGo to the section Internal structure.Approximately 70.8% of the planet's surface is occupied by the World Ocean[22], the rest of the surface is occupied by continents and islands. The continents contain rivers, lakes, underground waters, and ice, which together with the World Ocean make up the hydrosphereGo to the Hydrosphere section. Liquid water, essential for all known life, does not exist on the surface of any of the known planets and planetoids in the Solar System except Earth. The Earth's poles are covered by an ice shell, which includes the Arctic sea ice and the Antarctic ice sheet.The interior of the Earth is quite active and consists of a thick, highly viscous layer called the mantle, which covers a liquid outer core, which is the source of the Earth's magnetic field, and an inner solid core, believed to be composed of iron and nickel.[23] The physical characteristics of the Earth and its orbital motion have allowed life to survive for the past 3.5 billion years. According to various estimates, the Earth will retain conditions for the existence of living organisms for another 0.5 to 2.3 billion years.[24][25][26]Go to the Future section.The Earth interacts (is attracted by gravitational forces) with other objects in space, including the Sun and the Moon. The Earth revolves around the Sun and makes a full revolution around it in approximately 365.26 solar days - a sidereal yearGo to the Orbit and Rotation of the Earth section. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted by 23.44° relative to the perpendicular to its orbital plane, which causes seasonal changes on the planet's surface with a period of one tropical year - 365.24 solar days. A day is currently approximately 24 hours long.[2][27] The Moon began its orbit around the Earth approximately 4.53 billion years ago. The gravitational effect of the Moon on the Earth is the cause of ocean tidesGo to the Moon section. The Moon also stabilizes the tilt of the Earth's axis and gradually slows down the Earth's rotation.[28][29][30] According to some theories, asteroid impacts have caused significant changes in the environment and the Earth's surface, causing, in particular, mass extinctions of various species of living beings.The planet is home to approximately 8.7 million species of living beings, including humans.Go to the Biosphere section. The Earth's territory is divided by humanity into 193 UN member states, 2 UNGA observer states, 8 partially recognized and unrecognized states, and 2 states with special political status. Human culture has formed many ideas about the structure of the universe, such as the concept of a flat Earth, a geocentric world system, and the Gaia hypothesis, according to which the Earth is a single superorganismGo to the Role in Culture section."

    image: Mars,
    fullDescription: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the seventh largest in the Solar System. Along with Mercury, Venus, and Earth, it belongs to the family of terrestrial planets. It is named after Mars, the ancient Roman god of war, corresponding to the ancient Greek Ares.Go to the section In Mythology Due to the reddish hue of the surface, given to it by the mineral maghemite - γ-iron(III) oxide, Mars is called the Red Planet.Go to the section Soil. Mars is clearly visible from Earth with the naked eye. Its apparent stellar magnitude reaches -2.94m (at closest approach to Earth). Mars is second in brightness only to Jupiter (during the great opposition of Mars, it can surpass Jupiter), Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Opposition of Mars can be observed every two years. Go to the section Orbital characteristics. Mars has two natural satellites - Phobos and Deimos (translated from ancient Greek - fear and horror, the names of the two sons of Ares who accompanied him in battle), which are relatively small (Phobos - 26.8 × 22.4 × 18.4 km, Deimos - 15 × 12.2 × 10.4 km) and have an irregular shape. Go to the section Satellites. The mass of the planet is 10.7% of the mass of the Earth, and in linear size it is almost exactly half the size of the Earth. A year on Mars lasts 687 Earth days, or about 669 Martian solar days (sols). Mars experiences seasons similar to those on Earth, but its elongated orbit results in large differences in the length of seasons.[11]Go to the Physical Characteristics section. The atmosphere of Mars is very thin, with the pressure on its surface being approximately 160 times less than that of Earth. The large amount of dust causes dust storms, which have a significant impact on the temperature distribution in the atmosphere of Mars; strong dust storms can completely obscure the surface of the planet. The average temperature on Mars is ~210 K (−63 °C), with daily temperatures ranging from 184 K to 242 K (−89 to −31 °C).Go to the Atmosphere and Climate section. The relief of Mars has many unique features. The surface features of Mars include impact craters similar to those on the Moon, as well as volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps similar to those on Earth. Go to the Surface section Mars has historically been subject to plate lithosphere movement, just like Earth. Go to the Geology and Interior section. Mars has many geological features that resemble water erosion, including dry river beds, and minerals that could only have formed as a result of prolonged exposure to water. Recent evidence suggests that water was present in the past for geologically significant periods of time. Go to the Hydrosphere section The possibility of life on Mars has occupied people for centuries due to the planet's proximity and similarity to Earth. The scientific search for signs of life began in the 19th century and continues to this day. Go to the Life section. Mars has long been of interest not only to astronomers, but also to philosophers and artists. Go to the Culture section The first observations of Mars were made before the invention of the telescope. The heyday of telescopic observations of Mars occurred in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, and direct exploration of Mars using AMS began in 1962. By the beginning of the 21st century, Mars is the most thoroughly studied planet in the Solar System after Earth. As of 2024, the orbital research group in orbit around Mars includes seven functioning spacecraft: Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, Al Amal, and the orbital vehicle of the Chinese mission Tianwen-1. This is more than around any other planet, not counting Earth. In addition, the surface of Mars is currently being explored by two rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance.

Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture. Go to the section Saturn in Culture Saturn's symbol. Saturn is composed primarily of hydrogen, with traces of helium and water, methane, ammonia and heavier elements. The interior is a relatively small core of iron, nickel and ice, covered by a thin layer of metallic hydrogen and a gaseous outer layer. Go to the section nterior Structure. The planet's outer atmosphere appears calm and uniform from space, although long-term formations sometimes appear on it. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h in some places, which is significantly greater than on Jupiter. Go to the Atmosphere and Structure section Saturn has a planetary magnetic field, which is intermediate in strength between the Earth's magnetic field and the powerful field of Jupiter. Saturn's magnetic field extends 1,000,000 kilometers in the direction of the Sun. The shock wave was recorded by Voyager 1 at a distance of 26.2 Saturn radii from the planet itself, the magnetopause is located at a distance of 22.9 radii. Go to the Magnetic Field section. Saturn has a noticeable ring system, consisting mainly of ice particles, a smaller amount of heavy elements and dust. Go to the Rings section There are 146 currently known satellites orbiting the planet.

    image: Uranus,
    fullDescription: "Uranus is a planet in the Solar System, the seventh farthest from the Sun, the third largest in diameter, and the fourth most massive. It was discovered in 1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel and named after the Greek god of the sky, Uranus. Uranus was the first planet to be discovered in modern times and with the help of a telescope.[11] It was discovered by William Herschel on March 13, 1781, thereby expanding the boundaries of the Solar System in the eyes of man for the first time since antiquity. Although Uranus is sometimes visible to the naked eye, earlier observers mistook it for a dim star. Unlike the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, the depths of Uranus and the similar Neptune lack metallic hydrogen, but contain a lot of ice in its high-temperature modifications. For this reason, experts have classified these two planets as a separate category of ice giants. Uranus atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. In addition, traces of methane and other hydrocarbons have been found in it, as well as clouds of ice, solid ammonia, and hydrogen. This is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C). Uranus is believed to have a complex layered cloud structure, with water forming the lower layer and methane the upper layer[10]. The interior of Uranus consists mainly of ice and rock. Like the gas giants of the Solar System, Uranus has a ring system and a magnetosphere, as well as 28 satellites. Uranus's orientation in space differs from the other planets in the Solar System - its axis of rotation lies on its side relative to the plane of the planet's revolution around the Sun. As a result, the planet alternately faces the Sun with its north pole, its south pole, its equator, and its mid-latitudes. In 1986, the American spacecraft Voyager 2 transmitted close-up images of Uranus to Earth. They showed a planet that was “inexpressive” in the visible spectrum, without the cloud bands and atmospheric storms typical of other giant planets. However, ground-based observations have now managed to discern signs of seasonal changes and increased weather activity on the planet, caused by Uranus approaching its equinox. Wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 m/s (900 km/h)."

    fullDescription: "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Its mass is 17.2 times greater than that of Earth, making it the third largest planet in the Solar System. In terms of equatorial diameter, Neptune is fourth, 3.9 times greater than Earth.[10] The planet is named after Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. It was discovered on September 23, 1846, becoming the first planet discovered using mathematical calculations. The discovery of unpredictable changes in Uranus' orbit gave rise to the hypothesis of an unknown planet, the gravitational perturbation of which was responsible for them. Neptune was found within the predicted orbit. Its largest satellite, Triton, was soon discovered, and in 1949, Nereid. Neptune has only been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet on August 24–25, 1989. It discovered Neptune's rings and six of its moons. The remaining known moons of Neptune were discovered in the 21st century. Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both planets are distinct from the larger giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes placed in a separate category of ice giants. Neptune's atmosphere, like that of Jupiter and Saturn, consists primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains higher proportions of water, ammonia, and methane. The interiors of Neptune and Uranus consist primarily of ices and rock. Traces of methane in the outer layers of the atmosphere are responsible for the planet's blue color. Neptune's atmosphere is home to the strongest winds of any planet in the Solar System, with speeds estimated at up to 600 m/s.[17] Neptune's temperature in the upper atmosphere is close to −220 °C. Neptune's central temperature is estimated to range from 5000 K to 7000–7100 °C.[20][21] Neptune has a faint, fragmented ring system, possibly discovered as early as the 1960s but only confirmed by Voyager 2 in 1989. July 12, 2011 marked exactly one Neptunian year — or 164.79 Earth years — since the discovery of Neptune."
